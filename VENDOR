  VENDOR CHANGES
  ==============

  APPLICATION RULES
  -----------------

  The rpm5.org code base to a very restricted and limited scope contains
  some RPM changes from third-party distribution vendors. A vendor patch
  *might* be accepted for inclusion into the rpm5.org code base if it at
  least follows the following rules *and* is accepted after a detailed
  review by JBJ:

  1. RULE:
     at least one representative of a vendor has to be part of the
     official rpm5.org developer team. Additionally, the vendor and its
     representative is explicitly listed below.

  2. RULE:
     all source code changes have to be really surgically and
     minimally touching the rpm5.org code base only (no large code
     block reorderings, no accidential whitespace changes, etc).
     Additionally, all changes have to be *entirely* wrapped with "#if
     defined(RPM_VENDOR_<name-id>) /* <change-id> */... #endif" where
     <name-id> and <change-id> are explicitly listed in this document
     below under "Name" and "Change".

  VENDOR REGISTRY
  ---------------

  o  Name:           OPENPKG
     Vendor:         OpenPKG <http://openpkg.org/>
     Representative: Ralf S. Engelschall <rse@openpkg.org> <rse@rpm5.org>
     Application:    RPM-based Unix software distribution (> 1100 packages),
     Characteristic: cross-platform multiple-instance use of RPM
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         no-hard-coded-ugid
     Purpose:        do not make hard-coded assumptions about any uid/gid
     Reason:         OpenPKG can safely rely on the /etc/passwd and /etc/group
                     lookups for all uid/gid and has no need to assume
                     that for instance GID 0 is "root". Actually, such
                     an assumption is a portability problem as GID 0
                     under e.g. BSD is named "wheel" and not "root",
                     etc. As a result, things like "rpm -V" would report
                     wrong information, etc.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         splitted-source-directory
     Purpose:        support so-called "splitted source directories", i.e.,
                     source files (listed on SourceX and PatchX headers)
                     can be placed into %{_specdir} in addition to
                     %{_sourcedir}.
     Reason:         OpenPKG ultra-strictly separates sources files into
                     two classes: external ones -- those which are
                     referenced with fully-qualified URLs and can be
                     (re-)fetched from the Internet -- and internal
                     ones -- those which are references as plain files
                     and which are kept in the local version control
                     system (VCS). As in OpenPKG the .spec file is just
                     one of those "internal" files, they are all stored
                     under %{_specdir} while %{_sourcedir} is used
                     for everything which is downloaded from external
                     sources (in OpenPKG even an automated process).
     Hint:           The even better solution would be to introduce
                     %{_sourcedir_external} and %{_sourcedir_internal}
                     and support this throughout RPM.
                     (afb) rpm4darwin also separated these two, but
                     kept the internal in SOURCES and added a new
                     directory DISTFILES for holding the external...
                     The external ones were automatically fetched
                     from a central repository over HTTP if missing.
                     (http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/rpm4darwin/)
                     This can still be done in RPM, by setting the
                     two macros: %{_Rsourcedir} and %{_Rpatchdir}
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         explicit-platform
     Purpose:        Allow the platform identification be set explicitly only.
     Reason:         As OpenPKG is a cross-platform distribution,
                     the "platform" had to be determined by GNU shtool's
                     "shtool platform" script since many years. The
                     result is stored into the "platform" file which
                     RPM internally reads in. This way the platform is
                     explicitly set and no other implicit sets wished.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         no-deps-on-building-srpms
     Purpose:        Do not perform any dependency checking on building SRPMs.
     Reason:         We never found any reason why this is of any benefit for
                     just rolling a source RPM package.
     Hint:           (jbj) There is a benefit if you want digest(...) and/or
                     signature(...) verification of build elements before
                     inclusion in *.src.rpm. 
                     (rse) Yes, This is something we really want, OTOH
                     we really do NEVER want to have to install all
                     BuildPreReq _packages_ just to roll a SRPM. OTOH
                     "-bs --nodeps" then also skipps the wished checks.
                     Hmmm... we would need to replace the boolean
                     "noDeps" with DEPS_NONE, DEPS_INTEGRITY and
                     DEPS_ALL. DEPS_NONE is the old "noDeps = 1",
                     DEPS_ALL is the old "noDeps = 1" and DEPS_INTEGRITY
                     is new and would lead to the checking of only
                     those BuildRequires/BuildPreReqs which ensure the
                     integrity of the rolled SRPMS (currently AFAIK
                     "digest(...)", "signature(...)", "gnupg(...)", etc)
                     and especially skip the dependencies to installed
                     packages. Or even better: make DEPS_XXX bits of a
                     bitmask and allow one to assemble what one really
                     wished to be checked.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         always-remove-tempfiles
     Purpose:        Unconditionally remove temporary files ("rpm-tmp.XXXXX")
                     which were generated for the executed scripts.
     Reason:         In OpenPKG we run the scripts in debug mode ("set -x")
                     anyway, so we never need to see the whole generated
                     script -- not even if it breaks. Instead we would
                     just have temporary files staying around forever.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         no-default-doc-files
     Purpose:        Do not declare some files as %doc by default.
     Reason:         In OpenPKG we want to be explicit in the declaration
                     of %doc files and do it entirely from a package
                     %files section only. No magic in the code wished.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         still-support-section-clean
     Purpose:        allow us to still use %clean section
     Reason:         for temporary backward compatibility only
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         always-backup-on-patching
     Purpose:        always create backup files on patching files via %patch
     Reason:         In OpenPKG we maintain our patches via "rpm -bp" plus
                     subsequent "svs" commands, so we always want that
                     backup files are created.
     Hint:           We could explicitly specify -b all the time, too.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         bdb-no-partial-locking
     Purpose:        Perform full instead of partial record locking.
     Reason:         At least Solaris may reject (see its fcntl(2) manpage)
                     the (partial) locking, because BDB mmap(2)'ed the file
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         bdb-bugfix-fcntl-usage
     Purpose:        Fix the usage of fcntl(2)
     Reason:         POSIX/SUSv3 clearly expresses that fcntl(2)
                     returns "value other than -1" on success, so check
                     for equality to -1 instead of non-equality to 0.
                     In practice this does not harm on most platforms,
                     because they fortunately (by conincidence and
                     common practice) return 0.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         bdb-use-odirect-on-freebsd-only
     Purpose:        Use O_DIRECT on FreeBSD only
     Reason:         The O_DIRECT feature is fully broken under at least Linux
                     2.2 and 2.4. It is sometimes accepted by open(2)
                     without error and later causes a write(2) to fail
                     with EINVAL -- all depending on the underlying
                     filesystem (usually works on tmpfs and fails on
                     ext3). Sometimes it also causes open(2) to fail
                     with EINVAL. In general, it does especially no
                     "graceful degradation" and so is useless for use on
                     mostly all platforms except for those where we know
                     it works (currently FreeBSD only). Interestingly,
                     RPM works on RedHat, just because RedHat's "kernel"
                     package contains a patch which masks out O_DIRECT
                     usage... ;-)
     Hint:           O_DIRECT is very b0rken on linux. OTOH using vmalloc to
                     get page aligned buffer for I/O is merely obscure, easily
                     doable. Likely should be sent to Oracle.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         no-owner-group-on-srpm-install
     Purpose:        Do not set owner/group on installation/unpacking of SRPM
     Reason:         In OpenPKG it is not wished that file owner/group are
                     set on files during installation of _source_ RPMs.
                     Instead, the current run-time owner/group should
                     be used, because most of the time the owner/group
                     in the source RPM (which is the owner/group of the
                     files as staying on the package author system) is
                     not existing on the target system anyway.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         switch-from-susr-to-musr-on-srpm-install
     Purpose:        If running as the OpenPKG "susr", do not unpack source
                     RPM packages with "susr" file ownerships. Instead
                     unpack with "musr" file ownerships.
     Reason:         The OpenPKG Set-UID wrapper switches from "musr" to
                     "susr" on "openpkg rpm -Uvh *.src.rpm". As a result
                     the installed files could be never removed again by
                     "musr". It is more consistent to always unpack as
                     "musr" if possible.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         adjust-verbose-listing
     Purpose:        In verbose file listing output, give the owner and group
                     fields more width and at the same time reduce the
                     fields more nlink and size to typical sizes within
                     fields more OpenPKG.
     Reason:         Just cosmetics to improve output.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         larger-utsname
     Purpose:        Increase size of "struct utsname"
     Reason:         OpenPKG requires more space for storage
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         platform-major-minor-only
     Purpose:        Reduce the platform version to major and minor version numbers only.
     Reason:         Experience shows that more is never reasonable in practice.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         allow-excludedocs-default
     Purpose:        Do not override the %{_excludedocs} macro.
     Reason:         The "%_excludedocs" macro is intended to set the
                     _default_ if both --excludedocs and --includedocs
                     are not specified and it is evaluated already
                     before. So, do not override it here again, because
                     it would not allow us to make "%_excludedocs 1" the
                     default.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         bdb-allow-zero-sized-files
     Purpose:        Make sure RPM passes DB_CREATE to Berkeley-DB also
                     if file exists, but is (still) zero-sized.
     Reason:         In OpenPKG all database files are pre-created
                     to fixate permissions.
     Hint:           This might be obsolete soon as we now create real
                     BDB files instead of empty files.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         no-architecture-expose
     Purpose:        Do not expose the architecture in outputs.
     Reason:         This is too less information, as in OpenPKG the
                     "platform" is described by the
                     architecture+operating-system combination. But
                     as the whole "platform" information is actually
                     overkill, just revert to the RPM 4 behaviour and do
                     not expose any such information at all
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         auto-remove-source-directories
     Purpose:        Automatically remove source directories if they are empty.
     Reason:         In OpenPKG we use per-package %{_sourcedir} and
                     %{_specdir} definitions (macros have trailing
                     ".../%{name}"). On removal of source(s) and .spec
                     file, this per-package directory would be kept
                     (usually <prefix>/RPM/SRC/<name>/), because RPM
                     does not know about this OpenPKG convention. So,
                     let RPM try(!) to remove the two directories (if
                     they are empty) and just ignore removal failures
                     (if they are still not empty).
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         expand-macrosfile-macro
     Purpose:        Provide special pseudo-macro %{macrosfile}
     Reason:         In order to support local .rpmmacros (those
                     which stay directly inside a development area)
                     which redefine %{_specdir}/%{_sourcedir}/etc to
                     point to local directories, it is necessary to be
                     able to override those macros with absolute paths
                     relative to the .rpmmacros file itself. For this
                     it is necessary that one can expand a macro which
                     results in the pathname of the .rpmmacros file
                     itself. Together with %{dirname:...} and other
                     macro constructs this way one can allow arbitrarily
                     relocatable development environments.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         wildcard-matching-arbitrary-tagnames
     Purpose:        Allow wildcards in %{_arbitrary_tags}
     Reason:         In order to support e.g. "%_arbitrary_tags My*"
                     for custom but clearly distinguishable user
                     headers, the matching of tagnames is done via a
                     slower but more flexible linear search based on
                     fnmatch(3) instead of a binary search based on
                     strcasecmp(3).
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         no-auto-verbose-increase-for-track-and-fetch
     Purpose:        Do not enforce --verbose on -bt/-bf
     Reason:         RPM always enforces --verbose for all build commands
                     and this way renders the use of %{verbose:...}
                     useless for all types of build scripts. For all
                     other scripts this is already strange since years
                     (although at the other hand one usually always
                     wants "set -x" for the scripts by default and then
                     better be able to check for a --quiet option via
                     macros), but for %track we really want to control
                     verbosity explicitly. Similar to "-bf", where one
                     should be able to control verbosity manually.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         make-class-available-as-macro
     Purpose:        Do not treat "Class" tag as a fully arbitrary tag.
     Reason:         In OpenPKG some .spec processing depends on the
                     macro %{class} to be filled from the value of the
                     "Class" tag, hence make sure it is not treated fully
                     arbitrary (or else the macro would be not available).
     Hint:           As %_arbitrary_tags restricts the allowed tags anyway,
                     best would be to export also arbitrary tags as macros!
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         rpm-lua-extensions-based-on-rpm-lib-functionality
     Purpose:        Adds RPM Lua extensions based on "lib" functionality
     Reason:         The RPM Lua implementation is part of "rpmio". Hence
                     it cannot use RPM "lib" functionality without
                     breaking the RPM library dependency hierarchy.
                     Nevertheless it is very useful to have RPM "lib"
                     functionality in RPM Lua. The lib/rpmluaext.[ch]
                     provides this now. It attaches additional
                     functionality into the RPM Lua scope from within
                     RPM "lib". Currently it mainly provides the
                     following essential methods: rpm.digest() for
                     calculating a message digest, rpm.signature() to
                     check the public key signature on a clearsigned
                     file or a file and its detached signature, and
                     rpm.query() to query the RPMDB similar to "rpm -q
                     --qf '[...]' [-a] [...]" directly from within Lua.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         backward-compat-rpmtag-sourcepackage
     Purpose:        Still mark SRPMS with RPMTAG_SOURCEPACKAGE
     Reason:         For backward compatibility with RPM < 4.4.6
                     (remember: OpenPKG used RPM 4.2.1 until 2008) let
                     RPM 5 still mark SRPMS with RPMTAG_SOURCEPACKAGE.
                     This especially allows OpenPKG to smoothly upgrade
                     the "openpkg" package (which contains RPM) from the
                     RPM 4 to the RPM 5 world order. Without this the
                     upgrade procedure would involve manual "rpm2cpio"
                     plus "rpm -bb" operations.

     Change:         integrity-checking
     Purpose:        RPM integrity checking framework
     Reason:         [see scripts/integrity.txt for detailed documentation]
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         use-bsdtar-for-zip-files
     Purpose:        Use bsdtar(1) for unpacking ZIP format files.
     Reason:         OpenPKG uses bsdtar(1) to unpack ZIP format files to
                     avoid having to bundle the less portable unzip(1)
                     into the bootstrap package.
     Hint:           If RPM would use "%__unzip -qq" instead of "%{__unzip} -qq"
                     one could also use plain macros in OpenPKG to
                     convert the call to unzip(1) to bsdtar(1). But I
                     don't wanted to change RPM here as all other macros
                     are also just for the expansion of the command and
                     not for the complete command argument line.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         extension-based-compression-detection
     Purpose:        Prefer file extension for detecting file compression.
     Reason:         RPM tries to detect file compression by inspecting
                     "magic" bytes at the front of a file. This works
                     for formats with known "magic" bytes just fine,
                     but fails horribly for formats like LZMA where no
                     such "magic" bytes exist. As a result RPM 5 this
                     way too often thinks .tar files are LZMA compressed
                     and stumbles over this during build-time. For
                     OpenPKG we prefer to first use file extension
                     based determination (if someone is mis-names
                     his distribution files we have to take action
                     anyway) and fall back to "magic" byte based
                     determination only if no well known extension is
                     found. Additionally, detecting LZMA we want to do
                     via file extension only.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         regular-ordered-sources
     Purpose:        Internally regularily order the source files.
     Reason:         RPM internally traverses over the list of source files
                     (SourceX and PatchX tags in *.spec file) multiple
                     times and also looks up sources by number. For all
                     this the fact that RPM keeps the source files in a
                     _reverse ordered_ linked list is never a problem.
                     But OpenPKG performs user-visible actions, like
                     the auto-fetching of still missing source files,
                     and here the processing in reverse order is very
                     confusing to the user. Hence, order the sources
                     files in regular order (the order the tags occur in
                     the *.spec file).
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         always-strict-posix-option-parsing
     Purpose:        Always use strict POSIX-style option parsing.
     Reason:         OpenPKG wants RPM to always(!) use the
                     POPT_CONTEXT_POSIXMEHARDER flag to (again)
                     correctly parse macro arguments *without*
                     option/argument permutations now that we are using
                     POPT instead of getopt(3)!
                     Broken behavior without POPT_CONTEXT_POSIXMEHARDER:
                        $ rpm --define '%foo() <%*>' --eval '%{foo bar %(echo -n "quux") baz}'
                        error: Unknown option in macro foo(): -n: unknown option
                        <%*>
                     Fixed behavior with POPT_CONTEXT_POSIXMEHARDER:
                        $ rpm --define '%foo() <%*>' --eval '%{foo bar %(echo -n "quux") baz}'
                        <bar quux baz>
                     The explicit use of the POSIX "+" option is a
                     now implemented possibility, but for backward
                     compatibility OpenPKG wants that existing macros
                     are not broken.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         always-skip-proc-filesystem
     Purpose:        Always skip the /proc filesystem
     Reason:         OpenPKG never does anything with the virtual filesystem
                     /proc which exists on some platforms. Sometimes
                     (e.g. in a FreeBSD Jail) the problem even exists
                     that RPM discovers that /proc might be available
                     (because the FreeBSD host leaks this information
                     to the Jail) but /proc cannot be actually accessed
                     from within the Jail. As a result, RPM complains
                     with "error: failed to stat /proc: No such file
                     or directory" all the time.. As OpenPKG never
                     fiddles around with /proc from within RPM, in this
                     particular vendor environment /proc safely can be
                     just ignored.

     Reason:         For backward compatibility with RPM < 4.4.6 for all the
                     Fedora releases which are using RPM 4. RPM 5 will still
                     mark SRPMS with the RPMTAG_SOURCEPACKAGE. This especially
                     allows to switch between RPM 4 and 5 on Fedora. Without

     Change:         old-comparision-behaviour
     Purpose:        Keep old behaviour of comparision.
     Reason:         Since release tags like 0.beta1.1 etc. are very common in
                     Mandriva, new comparision behaviour will result in
                     comparision of these packages' EVR to be incorrect, with
                     newer treated as older and vice versa.

     Change:         no-owner-group-on-srpm-install
     Purpose:        Do not set owner/group on installation/unpacking of SRPM
     Reason:         In Mandriva it is not wished that file owner/group are
                     set on files during installation of _source_ RPMs.
                     Instead, the current run-time owner/group should
                     be used, because most of the time the owner/group
                     in the source RPM (which is the owner/group of the
                     files as staying on the package author system) is
                     not existing on the target system anyway.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         no-deps-on-building-srpms
     Purpose:        Do not perform any dependency checking on building SRPMs.
     Reason:         Don't really need this as 'digest(...)' and friends hasn't
                     been put to use (so far), making this just annoying.

     Change:         extension-based-compression-detection

     Change:         optional-dirname-and-symlink-deps
     Purpose:        Optional dependencies on symlinks and parent directories.
     Reason:         Mandriva doesn't store file lists in it's standard
                     synthesis metadata, resulting in any dependencies on these
                     not met during installation fail. Also always enforcing
                     these dependencies on third party packages which rarely
                     complies with distro policies, is of varying quality wrt.
                     quality and what not will also often lead to these having
                     files in directories not owned etc. Also in the case of
                     usage on systems not primarily using rpm, this will
                     ~always be an issue.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         loop-detection-optional-loglevel
     Purpose:        Report dependency loops at optional log level
     Reason:         Mandriva has many dependency loops by intentetion,
                     especially due to it's library package policies.
                     For now we want to be able to not display these as errors,
                     but rather as debug-level messages by default, or at any
                     other log level defined by %_loop_detection_loglevel.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         dont-filter-install-file-conflicts
     Purpose:        Always treat file conflicts during install as errors.
     Reason:         Mandriva takes a more stricter approach on allowing
                     file conflicts with policies requiring such cases to
                     be explicitly dealt with on packaging side rather than
                     relying on best effort. Several different versions
                     of package with same name or file names are therefore
                     not allowed when doing install ('rpm -i') of packages.

     Change:         rpm-python-archscore.patch

     Reason:         Different conventions for retrofitting platform string.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         rpm-white-color-upgrade.patch
     Purpose:        Color affinity while upgrading on multilib platforms.
     Reason:         When performing an upgrade, if we are capable of
                     installing multiple colors (elf32/elf64), we need to
                     verify that a white (color 0) package should be upgraded. 

                     The upgrade rules are:
                       If the package is white, and is noarch, it can always
                       be upgraded.

                       If the package is white, and not noarch, we only
                       upgrade if the arch is the same (or in the compatible
                       list).
         
                     Compatible arch's are stored in: _<arch>_compat_arch

                     Example of x86_32 and i686:
                       _i686_compat_arch i686 x86_32
                       _x86_32_compat_arch i686 x86_32
                     Order does not mean anything in this list.. one is not
                     "more compatible" then another.
     ________________________________________________________________________

     Change:         wrs-rpm-variants.patch
     Purpose:        Permit configurable arch strings.
     Reason:         Allow additional architectures to be added via a
                     "_known_arch" list. This is useful to allow for new
                     variants w/o having to modify RPM each time.
