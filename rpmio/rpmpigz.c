#define PIGZVERSION "pigz 2.1.4\n"

/* To-do:
    - add --rsyncable (or -R) [use my own algorithm, set min/max block size]

    - make build portable (currently good for Unixish)
 */

/*
   pigz compresses using threads to make use of multiple processors and cores.
   The input is broken up into 128 KB chunks with each compressed in parallel.
   The individual check value for each chunk is also calculated in parallel.
   The compressed data is written in order to the output, and a combined check
   value is calculated from the individual check values.

   The compressed data format generated is in the gzip, zlib, or single-entry
   zip format using the deflate compression method.  The compression produces
   partial raw deflate streams which are concatenated by a single write thread
   and wrapped with the appropriate header and trailer, where the trailer
   contains the combined check value.

   Each partial raw deflate stream is terminated by an empty stored block
   (using the Z_SYNC_FLUSH option of zlib), in order to end that partial bit
   stream at a byte boundary.  That allows the partial streams to be
   concatenated simply as sequences of bytes.  This adds a very small four to
   five byte overhead to the output for each input chunk.

   The default input block size is 128K, but can be changed with the -b option.
   The number of compress threads is set by default to 8, which can be changed
   using the -p option.  Specifying -p 1 avoids the use of threads entirely.

   The input blocks, while compressed independently, have the last 32K of the
   previous block loaded as a preset dictionary to preserve the compression
   effectiveness of deflating in a single thread.  This can be turned off using
   the --independent or -i option, so that the blocks can be decompressed
   independently for partial error recovery or for random access.

   Decompression can't be parallelized, at least not without specially prepared
   deflate streams for that purpose.  As a result, pigz uses a single thread
   (the main thread) for decompression, but will create three other threads for
   reading, writing, and check calculation, which can speed up decompression
   under some circumstances.  Parallel decompression can be turned off by
   specifying one process (-dp 1 or -tp 1).

   pigz requires zlib 1.2.1 or later to allow setting the dictionary when doing
   raw deflate.  Since zlib 1.2.3 corrects security vulnerabilities in zlib
   version 1.2.1 and 1.2.2, conditionals check for zlib 1.2.3 or later during
   the compilation of pigz.c.

   pigz uses the POSIX pthread library for thread control and communication,
   through the yarn.h interface to yarn.c.  yarn.c can be replaced with
   equivalent implementations using other thread libraries.  pigz can be
   compiled with NOTHREAD #defined to not use threads at all (in which case
   pigz will not be able to live up to the "parallel" in its name).
 */

/*
   Details of parallel compression implementation:

   When doing parallel compression, pigz uses the main thread to read the input
   in 'size' sized chunks (see -b), and puts those in a compression job list,
   each with a sequence number to keep track of the ordering.  If it is not the
   first chunk, then that job also points to the previous input buffer, from
   which the last 32K will be used as a dictionary (unless -i is specified).
   This sets a lower limit of 32K on 'size'.

   pigz launches up to 'zq->threads' compression threads (see --threads).  Each compression
   thread continues to look for jobs in the compression list and perform those
   jobs until instructed to return.  When a job is pulled, the dictionary, if
   provided, will be loaded into the deflate engine and then that input buffer
   is dropped for reuse.  Then the input data is compressed into an output
   buffer sized to assure that it can contain maximally expanded deflate data.
   The job is then put into the write job list, sorted by the sequence number.
   The compress thread however continues to calculate the check value on the
   input data, either a CRC-32 or Adler-32, possibly in parallel with the write
   thread writing the output data.  Once that's done, the compress thread drops
   the input buffer and also releases the lock on the check value so that the
   write thread can combine it with the previous check values.  The compress
   thread has then completed that job, and goes to look for another.

   All of the compress threads are left running and waiting even after the last
   chunk is processed, so that they can support the next input to be compressed
   (more than one input file on the command line).  Once pigz is done, it will
   call all the compress threads home (that'll do pig, that'll do).

   Before starting to read the input, the main thread launches the write thread
   so that it is ready pick up jobs immediately.  The compress thread puts the
   write jobs in the list in sequence sorted order, so that the first job in
   the list is always has the lowest sequence number.  The write thread waits
   for the next write job in sequence, and then gets that job.  The job still
   holds its input buffer, from which the write thread gets the input buffer
   length for use in check value combination.  Then the write thread drops that
   input buffer to allow its reuse.  Holding on to the input buffer until the
   write thread starts also has the benefit that the read and compress threads
   can't get way ahead of the write thread and build up a large backlog of
   unwritten compressed data.  The write thread will write the compressed data,
   drop the output buffer, and then wait for the check value to be unlocked
   by the compress thread.  Then the write thread combines the check value for
   this chunk with the total check value for eventual use in the trailer.  If
   this is not the last chunk, the write thread then goes back to look for the
   next output chunk in sequence.  After the last chunk, the write thread
   returns and joins the main thread.  Unlike the compress threads, a new write
   thread is launched for each input stream.  The write thread writes the
   appropriate header and trailer around the compressed data.

   The input and output buffers are reused through their collection in pools.
   Each buffer has a use count, which when decremented to zero returns the
   buffer to the respective pool.  Each input buffer has up to three parallel
   uses: as the input for compression, as the data for the check value
   calculation, and as a dictionary for compression.  Each output buffer has
   only one use, which is as the output of compression followed serially as
   data to be written.  The input pool is limited in the number of buffers, so
   that reading does not get way ahead of compression and eat up memory with
   more input than can be used.  The limit is approximately two times the
   number of compression threads.  In the case that reading is fast as compared
   to compression, that number allows a second set of buffers to be read while
   the first set of compressions are being performed.  The number of output
   buffers is not directly limited, but is indirectly limited by the release of
   input buffers to the same number.

Usage: pigz [options] [files ...]
  will compress files in place, adding the suffix '.gz'.  If no files are
  specified, stdin will be compressed to stdout.  pigz does what gzip does,
  but spreads the work over multiple processors and cores when compressing.

Options:
  -0 to -9, --fast, --best   Compression levels, --fast is -1, --best is -9
  -b, --blocksize mmm  Set compression block size to mmmK (default 128K)
  -p, --processes n    Allow up to n compression threads (default 8)
  -i, --independent    Compress blocks independently for damage recovery
  -R, --rsyncable      Input-determined block locations for rsync
  -d, --decompress     Decompress the compressed input
  -t, --test           Test the integrity of the compressed input
  -l, --list           List the contents of the compressed input
  -f, --force          Force overwrite, compress .gz, links, and to terminal
  -r, --recursive      Process the contents of all subdirectories
  -s, --suffix .sss    Use suffix .sss instead of .gz (for compression)
  -z, --zlib           Compress to zlib (.zz) instead of gzip format
  -K, --zip            Compress to PKWare zip (.zip) single entry format
  -k, --keep           Do not delete original file after processing
  -c, --stdout         Write all processed output to stdout (wont delete)
  -N, --name           Store/restore file name and mod time in/from header
  -n, --no-name        Do not store or restore file name in/from header
  -T, --no-time        Do not store or restore mod time in/from header
  -q, --quiet          Print no messages, even on error
